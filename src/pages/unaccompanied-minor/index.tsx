              <h4>Minor Travelers: Airlines Unaccompanied minor policies</h4>
              Airlines have dramatically varying policies and fees when it comes
              to children flying alone under the designation of an unaccompanied
              minor. Even within the United States, fees range from $50 to $150,
              some airlines don’t accept unaccompanied minors at all, some
              require the service until a child reaches 14 years old, while
              others will not offer it at all once a child reaches 12 years old.
              Some airlines let you connect on international itineraries to
              other airlines and some only permit nonstop domestic flights. The
              rules and fees for unaccompanied minors are truly all over the
              place, so let’s look at them:

                  Alaska Airlines calls its program “Junior Jetters,” but has
                  suspended meals and entertainment tablets, so asks that
                  caregivers pack meals and entertainment.
                </li>
                <li>

                  destination or connecting-point flights.
