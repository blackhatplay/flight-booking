                        gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition to its corporate
                        headquarters, Delta operates its primary hub in Atlanta as well as Delta

                        Boston-Logan is Delta's secondary transatlantic hub. Boston-Logan had
                        previously been a Delta hub from the latter half of the 20th century to
                        the early 2000s. The present Terminal A was built for Delta's sole use,
                        but following the 2005 bankruptcy, Delta scaled back operations and leased
                        11 gates in the terminal. Delta subsequently regained all the Terminal A
                            gates and began building up operations again in the mid-2010s, culminating in the reestablishing of BOS as a hub in 2019.</span>

                            serves as one of Delta's two Midwest hubs and is Delta's second-largest
                            overall. It is the primary Asian gateway for the Eastern United States and
                            it also provides service to many destinations in the Americas and Europe.</span>

                        Angeles is Delta's secondary hub for the West Coast. Delta inherited its
                        LAX hub from Western Airlines, but dismantled it in the mid-1990s, opting
                        to relocate most of those aircraft to the east coast. Since then, it has
                        re-opened the hub, offering service to select cities in Latin America,
                            Asia, Australia, and Europe, as well as major domestic cities and West Coast regional destinations.</span>

                        and is Delta's third-largest overall. It is the primary Canadian gateway
                        for the airline while also including many American metropolitan
                        destinations, a number of regional destinations in the upper Midwest as
      well as some select destinations in Europe and Asia.</span>

                        <span>New York–JFK – Delta's primary transatlantic hub. Delta inherited its JFK
                        hub from its partnership with Pan Am after Pan Am's collapse in 1991. The
                            hub also offers service on many transcontinental "prestige routes" to west coast destinations such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.</span>

                        <span>New York–LaGuardia – Delta's second New York hub. This important domestic
                        hub was created as a result of a slot swap with the now-defunct US
                        Airways. Delta's service at LaGuardia covers numerous East Coast U.S.
                            cities, and a number of regional destinations in the U.S. and Canada.</span>

                        United States and its fourth-largest overall. Delta service covers most
                        major U.S. destinations as well as a number of regional destinations in
                        the U.S. with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountain region, as well as select
                            destinations in Canada, Mexico, as well as select cities in Europe and Hawaii.</span>

                    <p>
                        <span>Seattle/Tacoma – Delta's primary West Coast hub. The hub serves as an
                        international gateway to Asia for the Western United States. Delta service
                        also includes many major U.S. destinations as well as regional
                        destinations in the Pacific Northwest. Delta started aggressively building
                            its presence in Seattle in 2011 and announced SEA's hub status in 2014, while notably sparking tensions with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines.</span>
